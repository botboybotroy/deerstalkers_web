<center><h1> Deerstalkers of Monterey Bay's website (WIP)</h1><br><br>
<p>Here dwell together still two men of note<br>
Who never lived and so can never die:<br>
How very near they seem, yet how remote<br>
That age before the world went all awry.<br>
But still the game’s afoot for those with ears<br>
Attuned to catch the distant view-halloo:<br>
England is England yet, for all our fears–<br>
Only those things the heart believes are true.<br>
<br>
A yellow fog swirls past the window-pane<br>
As night descends upon this fabled street:<br>
A lonely hansom splashes through the rain,<br>
The ghostly gas lamps fail at twenty feet.<br>
Here, though the world explode, these two survive,<br>
And it is always eighteen ninety-five.<br>
